# React PropTypes Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using PropTypes declarations
2. Describe when to use each declaration

## Overview

Simply have students practice validating props — we can spy on `console.warn()`
to see if it triggers for invalid props, etc.

Again, just make sure there's a solid narrative in place — it doesn't have to
have anything to do with validations per se, it should just frame the work that
students are doing and make it memorable.
